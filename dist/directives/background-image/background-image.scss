// Default styles for the background-size directive.  Assume that the caller
// wants a something like an <img> that grows to fill its container, but
// `contain` ensures the entire image is visible.  `cover` is another good
// value, it trades off being able to see the entire image for scaling it up
// to fill the container fully.

// Note that if IE supported `object-fit` a normal `<img>` could be used instead.
